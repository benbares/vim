# vimrc

I've been using the terminal Vim for a while, and it's just...well, kind of boring (no offense, Bram. You're awesome and we all love you). This is the first of probably many attempts to customize my workflow, specifically for Python develeopment. Tips, tricks, and further optimizations would be much appeciated!
